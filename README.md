# Portfolio Project

This project includes a main portfolio page, individual project pages, and associated styles and assets.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main portfolio page with featured projects slider, portfolio section, blog section, and contact form.
- `styles.css`: Combined CSS styles for the entire portfolio.
- Individual project pages: HTML files for each project with SEO enhancements.
- `icons/`: Directory containing placeholder images for social media icons.
- `submit-form.php`: Placeholder PHP script for handling contact form submissions.

## Implementation Notes
- Replace placeholder images and links with actual content.
- Implement server-side handling for the contact form (see `submit-form.php`).
- Further refine and customize the design as needed.
